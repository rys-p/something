            <p>To start, I want to apologize for something. I'm not really good at reading others' feelings, pero I'm sensing that you're feeling off today and the night before. So I apologize if I ever did something that made you feel that way. Ok, now unto the main reason why ginawa ko ito. I would like you to know that I like you. Not in a platonic way. Hindi ko ma-pin point when all of these started to happen. All I know is that the more I get to know you, the more na nagugustuhan kita. Honestly, at first, I only like you as a friend, nothing more than that. But during these past two months, the more we talk, the more I realize that what I'm feeling is something more. Alam ko naman na you're smart enough to pick up the hints I've been giving. The food, the painting, and the website with the message I made for you are not something I would do for a "friend." Lahat ng ito are out of my genuine interest. I know it's too early to tell, so I'm not expecting you to like me back. I just wanted you to know that I like you; this is to clear something up and to assure you that I appreciate you more than anyone else.</p>
